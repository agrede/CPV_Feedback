stopcpv : turns off closed-loop CPV tracking
startcpv : turns on closed-loop CPV tracking
dataon : turns on data stream to serial port
dataoff : turns off data stream to serial port
measpyr : reads voltage from bare pyranometer TIA and prints it to serial monitor
measpv : reads voltage from bare cell TIA and prints it to serial monitor
meascpv : reads voltage from concentrator cell TIA and prints it to serial monitor
getposz : gets absolute position from linear stages and prints it to serial monitor (X, Y)
cpvsmu : routes the concentrator cell to the SMU
cpvtia : routes the concentrator cell to the TIA
pvsmu : routes the bare cell to the SMU
pvtia : routes the bare cell to the TIA
setpv x : sends the value of x to the digipot controlling gain for the bare cell TIA
setcpv x : sends the value of x to the digipot controlling gain for the concentrator cell TIA
setdt x : sets the delay between feedback iterations to x (ms)
setdz x : sets the incremental movement distance between voltage samples to x (microns)
setav x : sets the number of reads to average over for sampling equal to x
